# Task_5
This pipeline will:

Checkout the code from the main branch
Install dependencies using npm
Run tests using npm test
Build a Docker image using the docker/build-push-action Github Action
Publish the Docker image to a container registry using the docker/build-push-action Github Action
Deploy the application to a production environment (using a hypothetical some/deployment-action Github Action)
To use this pipeline, you would need to create a Dockerfile in the root directory of your project that defines how to build your application into a Docker image. You would also need to update the tags parameter in the Build Docker image and Publish Docker image steps to use the appropriate name for your Docker image.
